# jsKatas

## Repository created to work out Java Script Katas on code wars

### What are code war Katas 
* Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. 
* On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as Kata. 
* These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.

### My approach
* From my experience with Tech Returners, I have adopted a TDD approach to solving these Katas
* It was a bit tough to work my way around TDD in the beginning, but found it quite helpful as I progressed
